# Stack and Queue Implementation

This Java program implements basic operations for both a Stack and a Queue using dynamic resizing arrays. The user can choose to work with either a stack or a queue, and perform operations like push/enqueue, pop/dequeue, and exit.

## Features
- **Stack Operations**:
  - **Push**: Add an item to the top of the stack.
  - **Pop**: Remove and return the item from the top of the stack.
  
- **Queue Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Add an item to the end of the queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove and return the item from the front of the queue.
  
Both the stack and the queue resize dynamically when their capacity is exceeded or when they are reduced in size due to a decrease in the number of elements.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java code:
   ```bash
   javac StackAndQueue.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
```bash

```
