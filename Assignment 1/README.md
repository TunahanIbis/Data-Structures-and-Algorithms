# Array Sorting

## Overview:
This Java program allows the user to input an array of integers and provides three sorting methods for sorting the array: 
- **Sort method** (Bubble Sort),
- **Selection Sort method**,
- **Insertion Sort method**.

The user can also choose whether to sort the array in **ascending** or **descending** order. The sorted array will be displayed after performing the selected sorting algorithm.

## Key Features:
- **User input handling**: The program accepts user input for the array size, elements, sorting method, and sorting order.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: It provides three different sorting techniques:
  - **Bubble Sort (Sort method)**: A basic sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort**: Finds the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted part and places it in its correct position.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into the correct position.
