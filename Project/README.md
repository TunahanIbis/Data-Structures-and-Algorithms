# Percolation Grid Project

## Overview

This project implements a **percolation system** using a grid-based approach. It simulates the flow of fluid through a porous medium, modeled as an **N × N** grid. The project was developed to enhance the understanding of **tree structures** and **union-find algorithms**.

## Features

- Simulates percolation using an **N × N grid**.
- Uses **union-find (disjoint-set)** to efficiently check connectivity.
- Supports **dynamic site opening and percolation detection**.

## Demo
You can see how the grids are created by the algorithm here:
